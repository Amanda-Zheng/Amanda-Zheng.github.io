Hi! I’m Xin Zheng (Amanda), a final-year Ph.D. student in the Faculty of Information Technology at Monash University, Australia. I’m co-advised by Prof. Shirui Pan and Prof. Chunyang Chen. I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Dalian University of Technology in 2017 and 2020, respectively. My research interests mainly lie in Graph Data-centric Machine Learning, Graph Neural Networks, Graph Neural Architecture Search.
