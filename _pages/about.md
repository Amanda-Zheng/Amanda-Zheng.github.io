Hi! I’m Xin Zheng (Amanda), a lecturer (a.k.a Assistant Professor) in the School of Information and Communication Technology, Griffith University, Australia. I finish my Ph.D. degree in the Faculty of Information Technology at Monash University, Australia, and I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Dalian University of Technology in 2017 and 2020, respectively. My research interests mainly lie in Graph Data-centric Machine Learning, Graph Neural Networks, Graph Neural Architecture Search.
